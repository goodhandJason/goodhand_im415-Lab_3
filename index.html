      I got into the whole RuPaul thing probably about 6 years ago, due to the fact my partner was and still is a huge fan. Since then I have also become a huge fan as well. I was really drawn to the creativity of the queens, as some of them are just hands down awesome at their craft.

        The drama was also really entertaining and just funny to watch. The cat fights, ups and downs, and ridiculous challenges that Ru Paul throws at the contestants are just awesome.

      Aside from the drama and creativity, I think that the show is a huge influence on gay culture and just pop culture in general. I'm very happy to see the LGBTQ+ community strutting their stuff on such a massive platform as it has grown to become today. I believe the show has a lot to teach society about acceptance, love, and just being who you are and not caring what anyone thinks.
