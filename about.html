        The premise of the show is basically Ru Paul, the original supermodel of the world, searching for the next drag superstar in the form of a reality TV competition. Contestants endure a series of grueling competitions testing them on their own charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent. Ru Paul then judges the contestants with his co hosts that vary sometimes from season to season, and a range of guest judges that work in the fashion, entertainment, or media business.

        The RuPaul’s Drag Race series today currently has 14 seasons, all based in America with American contestants. The main spin off featuring queens previously featured on the American series is RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars, which currently has 4 seasons aired. Additionally, RuPaul’s Drag race has international spins offs based in other countries that include Canada’s Drag Race (currently 2 seasons), Drag Race Holland (currently 2 seasons), Drag Race Thailand (currently 2 seasons), Drag Race UK (currently 3 seasons), Drag Race Spain (currently 1 season), Drag Race Down Under (currently 1 season) and most recently Drag Race UK VS the World (currently 1 season). Additionally, RuPaul’s Drag Race France has been announced and is currently in post-production.

        There are also “special” RuPaul drag race seasons that are somewhat entertaining, and not directly based on the original RuPaul Drag Race Series. These include RuPaul’s Drag U (3 seasons), in which each episode three “biological” women are given drag makeovers and taught to access their “inner diva’s”. There is also RuPaul’s Secret Celebrity Drag Race, currently 1 season with another on the way, in which each episode a celebrity guest is given a drag makeover and mentored by Drag Race alumni!

        Although each season is based off the same competition premise, in my opinion they are all worth watch as each on offers something captivating, unique, and inspirational in its own way.
