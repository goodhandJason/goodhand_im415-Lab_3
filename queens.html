title: Fav Queens
---

<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
<p class="blurbs">These are my top choices for favorite queens out of all the RuPaul's Drag Race Seasons. This isnt counting the additional franchise shows like All Stars, UK, Netherlands, Thailand etc just to narrow it down a bit. I've seen every season at least three times at this point the drama is GREAT and the creativity is absolutely amazing. There really is only a handful of queens I could say I dont like, so narrowing them down to nine of my favourites is difficult.</p>
